    <h3>Short Answer:</h3>
    <p><em>
      No. Wheat is good, but we have other really good options like millets (Jowar, Ragi, etc.) and quinoa. Wheat is a problem only if a person is gluten-allergic or wheat intolerant, which, if you're wondering whether you are, you likely are not.
    </em></p>
    <p>Wheat contains a protein called ‚Äúgluten‚Äù (~8g per 100g of wheat). It is what gives wheat products their chewy and rubbery texture. Most people can digest gluten just fine, but some (0.5 to 1%) can't. These people are allergic to gluten, with symptoms like uneasiness due to bloating and gas.</p>
    <p>Wheat is a great food to have. It has a moderately low glycemic index (54), contains protein, and is widely available. The only drawback is that it doesn't have a complete amino acid profile, which is important for a well-rounded meal and proper absorption of nutrients from your food. This is generally not a problem since wheat is mostly eaten along with other ingredients that complete the meal's amino acid profile.</p>
    <h3>Great Alternatives</h3>
    <p>This is where grains like millets (Jowar, Ragi, etc.) and quinoa shine. In addition to having a similarly low glycemic index to that of wheat and an even higher protein content, they also have a more complete amino acid profile. Another good thing is that they are gluten-free.</p>
    <p>Regardless of whether or not you have a problem with gluten, you should try these other grains and see if you like them.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>A little while ago, I found out that almond milk is really good for you, so I ordered it. That morning, I excitedly sat down to have it along with breakfast. I took a sip and nearly vomited. It made me feel sick, so I never had it again.</p>
    <p>Your body is a survival machine. Listen to your body. If eating something makes you feel sick, don't have it. Don't consume wheat if it makes you sick; don't reject it because it's cool to do so.</p>
    <p>Keep trying until you find what's best for you!</p>
